Test Research Paper

Abstract
This is a test paper for validating the async upload workflow using Celery.
Machine learning enables natural language processing.

Introduction
Transformer architectures revolutionize document analysis.
We explore semantic search capabilities using vector databases.

Methodology  
We use sentence transformers for embedding generation.
The system processes PDFs and creates vector embeddings.

Results
Search queries return relevant chunks with high accuracy.
The workflow successfully handles async processing.

Conclusion
Celery enables scalable document processing.
